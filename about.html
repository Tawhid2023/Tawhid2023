 <strong><a href="index.html">  Bangladesh Blood Bank </a> </strong> is a site that is run non-goverment and privately funded . The site is designed and developed by Md. Tawhid Ul Islam. Published by<strong><a href="index.html">  Bangladesh Blood Bank </a> </strong>  from Amtali Upazila of Barguna District. <br><br>
The site was created in the hope of benefiting the country and the world, even if not for oneself. Even in the modern age of civilization, when people are dying in need of blood, dying for lack of it, it is very heartbreaking. For human beings, it is the religion of humanity to stand by one another in danger. It will be a means to stand by the brother in danger. <br><br>
Treatment is one of the basic human needs. In addition to the need for blood, people need a good doctor when they are sick. It is not uncommon for a patient to die without consulting a good doctor in time. <br>
Many times the necessary treatment is not available in the upazila headquarters, you have to go to the district or divisional headquarters. <br><br>
Without relatives and distance accurate information of doctors is not available. The patient is in misery. Need to stay in the hotel. Staying in a hotel for a middle class and poor class patient is like a blow to death. <br>
The information of all the doctors and clinics of the country is not recorded in one place. This is my small initiative to record the information of the respected humanitarian servants in one place. First of all, maybe not all the information will be available on this site.It will be possible with the joint participation of all in the course of time, InshaAllah. <br><br>
This site was not created for any business purpose but to stand by the needs of the people. It is not possible to take any work forward for one. So I wish the joint participation of all. Most of the citizens of Bangladesh can be blood donors. Everyone will have an application to register as a blood donor. To find out if necessary. <br><br>
Appeal to the honorable servants of humanity to be added to the doctor's database, to be updated regularly. <br><br>
Since the site is made for social service, it is not possible to go far alone. The site is not mine, everyone. I want to go ahead with everyone. Money is needed to improve the site. If any kind-hearted person wants to make a donation on the site, it is specially requested to   <a href="contact.html" > contact </a>  . I promised that your donation will be used for social service.   <br><br>
